This study is to prove Capomulina medication has better outcomes in reducing tumor size vs. the seven other medication treatments used in the trial.  Two hundred fifty mice with SCC tumors were used for testing.

Summary: 

The most effective drug regimen is Capomulin, which has the lowest average tumor volume while on the medication. Ketapril regimen is the worst performing medication having the highest tumor growth average. 

Capomulina and Ramicane have the highest number of applications on this type of medication and shows the lowest average growth of tumor size while on using Capomulina and Ramicane vs. the rest of the drugs.

The mice used were evenly divided between male and female mice, almost a 50/50 spread.

Capomulina medication showed a negative correlation, which in this case, is good. For example, Mice number s185 shows that the tumor size decreased as time progressed, helping to confirm that Capomulina medication is most effective. 

The weight of mice also increases as the tumor size increases. 

Conclusion:

I would recommend using Capomulina medication to reduce tumor size vs. the rest of the medication used in this trial. Ramicane would be the 2nd option to recommend. Mice number k403 showed a similar reduction of tumor size using Ramicane medication when compared to mice number s185 using Capomulina over a similar time frame.
